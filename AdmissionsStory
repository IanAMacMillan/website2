            The Society of Physics Students is collaborating with other science departments and clubs at American University to put on its annual haunted house this Friday at the Sports Center Annex.

            The haunted house, called Haunted SCAN, is the biggest event that the Society of Physics Students puts on every year. Event organizers have been working for months, reaching out to other organizations, securing funding, and planning the event. Some of the individual planning is left to the participating organizations with financial help from the Student Activities Office and its respective departments.
            
            </p>
            
            <p>
            
            “This year, Haunted SCAN features a laser maze, vampires, zombies, and other scary surprises,” said Sarah McBride, president of the Society of Physics Students. “Every year is a different experience that will scare even people with nerves of steel.”
            
            </p>
            
            <p>
            
            The event brings together many of <a href="http://www.american.edu/cas/sciences/" class="boldlink">American University’s science departments</a> and clubs, including the chemistry department and the Not Math Club.
            
            </p>
            
            <p>
            
            “We are really excited to be working with other science and math organizations,” said McBride. “Every year we are surprised by how innovative all of the participating organizations are. AU’s sciences can be really scary when they want to be.”
            
            </p>
            
            <p>
            
            The haunted house is broken up into sections, each run by a different department or club. Many of the sections have a theme that relates back to the department who planned it. The chemistry department has a room filled with various chemical reactions. Event goers will be lead by a tour guide through all of the different spaces where volunteers are waiting to scare.
            
            </p>
            
            <p>
            
            American University’s faculty are also participating in Haunted SCAN. <a href="http://www.american.edu/profiles/faculty/newport.cfm" class="boldlink">Johnathon Newport,</a> physics lab director, has been working on mechanical traps for the haunted house made from scratch using pneumatics and other tools in the physics labs. The haunted house has become a tradition that many students and faculty members look forward to.

            <p>
            
            “My favorite haunted house was when the physics department was moving out of McKinley,” said Professor <a href="http://www.american.edu/cas/faculty/harry.cfm" class="boldlink">Greg Harry</a> of the American University Physics Department. “They were gutting the building for renovation so we could do whatever we wanted. We even painted on the walls.”
            
            </p>
            
            <p>
            
            The Society of Physics Students will continue the tradition of hosting a haunted house next year when they move to the <a href="http://www.american.edu/buildingAU/eastoverview.cfm" class="boldlink">Technology and Innovation Building in East Campus.</a>
            
            </p>
            
            <p>
            
            The Haunted SCAN will take place Friday, Oct. 28 from 6-9 p.m. and is free to everyone.
